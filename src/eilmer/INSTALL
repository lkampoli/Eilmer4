Prerequisite software
---------------------
To build eilmer, you will require:

  + A C compiler (GNU compiler is a good option and standard on most systems)
  + A D compiler (The DMD compiler is a good choice)
  + readline development package
  + ncurses development package

First-time setup
----------------

Make a directory to house the eilmer executables and support files.
In this example, I've called the install directory 'dgdinst' under my
$HOME area.

> mkdir $HOME/dgdinst

Configure your environment to use eilmer. You will need to set the
DGD variable to point to the top of the installation tree. You then
also need to set $PATH, $DGD_LUA_PATH and $DGD_LUA_CPATH to point to
the appropriate places. Some example lines from a .bashrc file are::

   export DGD=$HOME/dgdinst
   export PATH=$PATH:$DGD/bin
   export DGD_LUA_PATH=$DGD/lib/?.lua
   export DGD_LUA_CPATH=$DGD/lib/?.so

Remember to refresh your current shell (or log out and log back in) so
that your newly configured environment is available.

Compilation and installation
----------------------------

To install to your chosen directory, issue the following command
from within this directory:

> make INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/dgdinst install
