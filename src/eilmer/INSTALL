Quick installation guide

First-time setup
----------------

Make a directory to house the eilmer executables and support files.
In this example, I've called the install directory 'dgdinst' under my
$HOME area.

> mkdir $HOME/dgdinst

Configure your environment to use eilmer. You will need to set the
DGD_SRC variable to point to the top of this source tree and also
add the 'dgdexec' directory to $PATH, $DGD_LUA_PATH and $DGD_LUA_CPATH.
Some example lines from a .bashrc file are::

   export DGD_SRC=$HOME/dgd
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dgdinst
   export DGD_LUA_PATH=$HOME/dgdinst/?.lua
   export DGD_LUA_CPATH=$HOME/dgdinst/?.so

Remember to refresh your current shell (or log out and log back in) so
that your newly configured environment is available.

Compilation and installation
----------------------------

To install to your chosen directory, issue the following command
from within this directory:

> make INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/dgdinst install
