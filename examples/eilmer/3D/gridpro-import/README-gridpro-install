== Overview
With some small edits, one can add the Eilmer boundary conditions to the
Gridpro GUI menu. This is done by adding a file to the Gridpro installation
and editing an entry in the installation files.

Then, when using Gridpro, one selects Eilmer as the solver and the Eilmer-specific
boundary conditions will be available for use.

== One-time install/edit of files
These instructions follow closely the ones given in the Gridpro WS GUI manual
in Appendix A.

* Find your Gridpro installation and edit: `GridPro/az_mngr/ws_ptymap.menu`
Add a line for Eilmer anywhere of your choosing. (We think the top spot is best!):
+
  Eilmer &pty=Eilmer & ws_ptymap.eilmer

 * Copy the file from this directory `ws_ptymap.eilmer` to that install area `GridPro/az_mngr/`
