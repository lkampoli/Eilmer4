This is an adaptation of the 2-D moving piston example for verification 
of the moving grid implementation in 3-D. 

This directory contains an Eilmer example of simulating the motion
of a piston in a duct and its effect on the gas in front of the
piston. The particular feature that is demonstrated in this example
is that of the moving grid capability in Eilmer.

There is an extra file required in this simulation that is not
needed in static grid simulations. That file is "grid-motion.lua"
and it specifies how the grid moves throughout the simulation.
Specifically, it specifies the vertex velocities of all grid
points in the grid as a function of time. This is how the grid
motion is handled in Eilmer: the user must specify the velocities
of the grid points and then Eilmer takes care of updating their
positions.

Another aspect of this simulation that is a little different from
the usual is the use of a user-defined boundary condition. The 
boundary effect at the piston face is a customised effect and
so we build a user-defined boundary condition to handle that
effect. This can be inspected in the file "piston-bc.lua"

This example can be run in the usual manner:

> ./prep.sh
> ./run.sh
> ./post.sh

At the end, a series of VTK files are produced and placed in the
plot/ subdirectory. You may then use Paraview to inspect the
flow field and make an animation of the moving piston simulation.

You can also extract a line data and plot that as an x-y line plot.
To do that use:

> ./extract-profile.sh
