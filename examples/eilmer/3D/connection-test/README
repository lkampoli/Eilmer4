How to run the test
-------------------

1. Generate the reference case.

> python generate-ref-result.py

[THIS ASSUMES THE EAST-WEST-0 CONNECTION IS GOOD! Let's hope so.]

2. Run the tests for all 144 connections.

> python run-cases.py

3. The test results are written to: test-results.txt
If all passes, we should get not the word 'FAILED' anywhere
in the results file. For a succesful test, e would like the
grep for 'FAILED' in the results file to give us nothing.

> grep FAILED test-results.txt
