This is a port from Eilmer3 to Eilmer4 of Han Wei's heated-plate with step
for his NUS experiments.

I have set it up to start on my 8-core workstation with Han's full resolution.
Only 250 steps are requested and the 348 blocks are assigned to run
on just 8 cores.  This arrangement should be modified before running on a real
cluster computer.
