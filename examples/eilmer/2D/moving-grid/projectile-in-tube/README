This directory contains an Eilmer example of simulating of 
a gas reservoir expanding and thereby pushing a projectile 
ahead. The simulation is based on the projectile-in-tube 
example reported by XXXX and also used as the verification case for L1d3.

There are two extra files required for this simulation to allow
for the two-way coupling between the fluid (pressure acting on
projectile) and projectile which accelerates and allows the 
gas to expand. The first is "udf-process.lua" and it extracts 
the total force acting on the projectile. It also calculates the 
acceleration of the piston, which is used to obtain the 
instantaneous projectile velocity. This velocity is then passed 
to "grid-motion.lua", which sets the correct velocity for all 
points in the grid. 
Grid motion is specified for the block as a whole by setting 
the velocity of the four corner points. 

This example can be run in the usual manner:

> ./prep.sh
> ./run.sh
> ./post.sh

At the end, a series of VTK files are produced and placed in the
plot/ subdirectory. You may then use Paraview to inspect the
flow field and make an animation of the moving piston simulation.

You can also extract a line data and plot that as an x-y line plot.
To do that use:

> ./extract-profile.sh
