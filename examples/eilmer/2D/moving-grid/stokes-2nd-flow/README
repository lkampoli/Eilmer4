This directory contains an Eilmer example simulating what 
is known a Stokes Second Flow. 
See: 
Schliching, H (1979), Boundary-Layer Theory, 
McGraw-Hill, New York for details. 
Stoke's second flow consists of viscous flow adjacent to a 
wall that oscilates in the tangential direction with 
tangential velocity:

    u(t) = U_max * cos(omega * t)
 
For laminar flow, this has an analytical solution to the
Navier Stokes Equation, given by:

    u(y,t) = u_max * exp(-y * sqrt(omega / (2*nu)) 
            * cos(omega * t - y * sqrt(omega / (2*nu)))

This flow alos has a solution for the shear stress acting 
on the wall:

    t_wall = d u(y,t) / dy |_y=0 
           = rho * u_wall * sqrt(omega / (2*nu)) 
             * (sin(omega * t) - cos(oemag * t) )
 
For the simualtion this type of flow can be use a single block. 
The bottom wall is set as the moving wall and top wall as fixed 
pressure. The left and righ wall can be set as simple extrapolation
boundary conditions as the flow result is constant with
respect to x.

This example can be run in the usual manner:

> ./prep.sh
> ./run.sh
> ./post.sh

At the end, a series of VTK files are produced and placed in the
plot/ subdirectory. You may then use Paraview to inspect the
flow field and make an animation of the moving piston simulation.

You can also extract a velocity profile data at different values 
of (omega*t) and plot this agains the analytical solution. 
To do that use:

> ./extract-profile.sh
