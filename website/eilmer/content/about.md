## What does Eilmer do

The Eilmer code is a program for the numerical simulation of transient,
compressible gas flows in two and three dimensions.
This program answers the "What if ... ?" type of question 
where you will set up a flow situation by 
defining the spatial domain in which the gas moves,
set an initial gas state throughout this domain, 
specify boundary condition constraints to the edges of the domain and
then let the gas flow evolve according to the rules of gas dynamics.

## Who built Eilmer, and why

The principal developers of Eilmer are Peter Jacobs and Rowan Gollan,
both at the University of Queensland.
There have been many contributors to the project over the years.
The complete list of contributors is available [here](/contributors).

Eilmer began life as a tool to simulate and aid in the of design shock tunnels
and expansion tubes.
It has also been applied to the analysis of the experiments undertaken
in shock tunnels and expansion tubes.

More recently, Eilmer is being used in the simulation and design of
hypersonic inlets, turbomachinery and microcombustors.

## Features

+ 2D/3D compressible flow simulation
+ Gas models include ideal, thermally perfect, equilibrium, multi-temperature
+ Finite-rate chemistry
+ Inviscid, laminar, turbulent (k-omega) flows.
+ Solid domains with conjugate heat transfer in 2D.
