The supporting documentation for **Eilmer** is available for download:

- [Eilmer4 User Guide](/pdfs/eilmer-user-guide.pdf)
- [Geometry Package User Guide](/pdfs/geometry-user-guide.pdf)
- [Gas Package User Guide](/pdfs/gas-user-guide.pdf)

The user guide for **foamMesh** is also available:

- [foamMesh User Guide](/pdfs/foammesh-user-guide.pdf)

Reference Guides
----------------
There are Reference Manuals for boths users and developers:

- [Eilmer Reference Manual for Users, v4.0](/html/users-reference-manual.html)



Presentations and seminars
--------------------------

Over the years, we have presented various aspects on the formulation,
physical models, applications and use of Eilmer. Presentation slides
are available for download. Some slides contain user input tips, but please note
that the finer details of user input may change over time.
These slides are not updated, but rather serve as historical record of activities.
Instead, check the User Guide for the definitive user input.

- [Estimating parallel compute performance for Eilmer simulations](/pdfs/cfh-seminar-oct-2019.pdf), 03 October 2019.  
  RJG seminar to the Centre for Hypersonics research group on estimating
  parallel performance in the context of Eilmer simulations.
  The presentation also includes discussion of the available
  load-balancing techniques and examples of their use.
  A simple method of timing tests is presented that can be used
  to give a quick assessment of parallel performance.

- [Progress of the Eilmer 4 transient flow solvers](/pdfs/eilmer-talk-pj-aug-2019.pdf), 29 August 2019.  
  PAJ seminar to the Centre for Hypersonics research group, with some discussion on MPI, complex numbers,
  one-sided flux calculator and moving grids,
  complex 2D grids and an oscillating-jet injector simulation.
  
- [User-defined Run-time Customisation for Eilmer Simulations](/pdfs/cfh-seminar-jul-2018.pdf), 19 July 2018.    
  RJG seminar on user-defined customisation in Eilmer to the Centre for Hypersonics at The University of Queensland.

- [Eilmer 4.0: A toolkit for doing gas-dynamic calculations](/pdfs/eilmer-talk-pj-july-2018.pdf), 5 July 2018.  
  PAJ seminar on applications of Eilmer for gas dynamics to the Centre for Hypersonics at The University of Queensland.
  Includes some discussion on running MPI jobs, a state-to-state Brayton cycle calculation,
  the rebuild of Poshax as a Lua script,
  and simulation of the X3R with the step in its shock tube.

- [Computational Hypersonics Research at The University of Queensland](/pdfs/rjg-seminar-strathclyde-2018-06-08.pdf), 8 June 2018.
